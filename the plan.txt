entity rendering uses immediate mode, where all the vertices for all the quads for all the entities
are loaded into a vertex consumer, and then drawn

instead, have one instanced draw call for every body part of an entity. so one call for the body, one for the head
etc etc. if there is only 1 entity, use immediate mode instead. if there is more than 1, use instanced drawing
to instance the body parts.
